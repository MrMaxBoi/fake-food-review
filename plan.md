# Fake Food Review Detector - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building user stories for a web application that detects fake restaurant reviews by analyzing review patterns, linguistic cues, and providing explainable verdicts.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅
- [x] **Step 1**: Analyze core user personas and their needs
  - *Primary: General consumers checking review authenticity*
  - *Secondary: Moderators/platform owners monitoring suspicious patterns*
- [x] **Step 2**: Define primary user journeys and workflows
- [x] **Step 3**: Identify key features and functionality scope
  - *Synthetic/sample reviews for demo, anonymous access, no PII*

### Phase 2: User Story Creation ✅
- [x] **Step 4**: Write core search and analysis user stories
- [x] **Step 5**: Write review display and explanation user stories  
- [x] **Step 6**: Write data storage and retrieval user stories
- [x] **Step 7**: Write user interface and interaction user stories

### Phase 3: Review & Refinement ✅
- [x] **Step 8**: Review all user stories for completeness and clarity
- [x] **Step 9**: Add acceptance criteria to each user story
- [x] **Step 10**: Organize stories by priority and dependencies

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅
- [x] **Step 11**: Create final user stories document in inception directory
- [x] **Step 12**: Final review and approval

### Phase 5: Architectural Grouping
- [x] **Step 13**: Analyze user stories for logical grouping and dependencies
- [x] **Step 14**: Create units directory structure
- [x] **Step 15**: Define Review Analysis Unit (rule-based detection with explainability focus)
- [x] **Step 16**: Define Data Storage & Retrieval Unit (DynamoDB persistence and caching)
- [x] **Step 17**: Define Frontend UX Unit (user interface and interactions)
- [x] **Step 18**: Validate unit boundaries and dependencies (loosely coupled via API contracts)
- [x] **Step 19**: Create unit documentation files
- [x] **Step 20**: Review unit groupings for completeness

## Architectural Decisions Confirmed:
1. **Review Analysis**: Simple rule-based/mocked detection with focus on explainability
2. **Storage**: DynamoDB for AWS-native persistence layer
3. **Independence**: Loosely coupled units with API contract integration
